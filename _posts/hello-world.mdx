## At least some good news this year

Phew! The blog was under construction for quite some time now. It was my little journey
to come up with something straight forward, modern, clean, and clever. It turned out to be
quite a challenge in the end.

My perfectionism sent at least three iterations of layouts to the
trash can. I've spent four months picking a font family, color, and size combination.
But it's finally here! And I'm very proud of the result.

Now there is no excuse for me to postpone the dream of becoming a blogger and writing
articles and reviews about things I love and hate.

## My Goals

1. Conquer my perfectionism and learn to do good enough fast enough.
2. Improve my english writing skills.
3. Share knowledge and experience to help make the internet a better place.
4. Accumulate an impressive portfolio of articles. ðŸ˜Ž
5. Entertain you and myself in the process.

I hope to create at least one post a week, so stay tuned!

## What to expect?

Mostly Web related stuff. Development guides and tricks, my reflections, and whining on the IT-sphere.
Projects announcements, funny stories, and updates about my life. Anime reviews
and abstract memes that I've seen today, perhaps. A direct mindflow of emotions and
experience that I send to space. You can treat this blog as a personal diary if you want.
But with no fearful secrets, obviously. ðŸ˜…

Stay safe and see you in 2021, Space Cowboy!
